        "1. Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of an object while ignoring the irrelevant details. It focuses on defining the interface or blueprint of a class, specifying what it does without revealing how it does it. Abstraction allows developers to hide the complexity of an object's implementation and interact with it at a higher, more conceptual level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Consider a car as an object. When abstracting a car, you focus on its essential properties (e.g., make, model, color) and behaviors (e.g., start, stop, accelerate) without concerning yourself with the internal mechanisms (e.g., engine, transmission) that make these actions possible. In code, an abstract class or interface for a car might define methods like \"start()\" and \"stop()\" without specifying how each make and model of car actually implements these methods.\n",

        "2. Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on that data into a single unit, often referred to as a class. It restricts direct access to the internal state of an object and enforces controlled access through methods. Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding, data protection, and modularity, making it easier to maintain and modify code without affecting other parts of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Consider a bank account as an object. Encapsulation would involve encapsulating the account's balance as a private attribute and providing methods to interact with it, such as deposit and withdraw. This ensures that the balance can only be modified through these controlled methods.\n",

        "```python\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",

        "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "        if amount > 0:\n",
        "            self.__balance += amount\n",

        "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
        "        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.__balance:\n",

        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance\n",

        "# Usage\n",
        "account = BankAccount(1000)\n",

        "account.withdraw(200)\n",
        "print(\"Current balance:\", account.get_balance())  # Can access balance only through a method\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the balance attribute is encapsulated and can only be modified or accessed through the deposit, withdraw, and get_balance methods, ensuring data integrity and control.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, abstraction focuses on defining high-level interfaces for objects, while encapsulation focuses on bundling data and methods together and controlling access to that data. Together, these concepts enhance code organization, maintainability, and data protection in object-oriented programming."
