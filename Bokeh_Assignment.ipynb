They are essentially geometric shapes that encode your data points and convey information visually. Bokeh offers a rich set of glyphs for creating various chart types, including lines, circles, squares, bars, wedges, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how you can add glyphs to a Bokeh plot:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Choose the appropriate glyph function:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Bokeh provides different functions for different glyph types. Here are some common examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `.line(x, y)`: This function adds a line connecting your data points in (x, y) coordinates.\n",
        "* `.circle(x, y, size)`: This function adds circles at the specified (x, y) locations with a particular size (diameter).\n",
        "* `.square(x, y, size)`: This function adds squares at the specified locations with a particular size (side length).\n",

        "Most glyph functions allow you to customize their appearance using additional arguments. These arguments can control:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Size:** You can specify the size of the glyph (e.g., diameter for circles, side length for squares, width/height for bars).\n",
        "* **Color:** You can set the fill color or line color of the glyph.\n",
        "* **Line style:** For lines, you can choose solid, dashed, dotted, etc. styles.\n",

        "p.<glyph_function>(x, y, additional_arguments...)\n",

        "    * Update the visual appearance of the plot (e.g., highlighting data points, changing colors).\n",
