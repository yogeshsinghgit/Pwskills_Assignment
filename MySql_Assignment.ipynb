        "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that facilitates efficient storage, retrieval, and management of that data. Databases are used in a variety of applications, ranging from simple to complex, to store and manage information.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main types of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL). Here are the primary differences between them:\n",
        "\n",
        "**SQL Databases:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Structured Query Language (SQL):** SQL databases are based on a language called SQL, which is a standard language for interacting with relational databases. SQL databases are also known as relational databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Schema:** SQL databases have a predefined schema, which means the structure of the data (tables, columns, and relationships) is defined before any data is inserted. All data must conform to this schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Integrity:** SQL databases follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and consistency even in the case of failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Scaling:** Scaling SQL databases can be challenging, especially when dealing with a large volume of data and high traffic. Vertical scaling (upgrading the hardware) is a common approach, but it has limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NoSQL Databases:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Not Only SQL (NoSQL):** NoSQL databases are designed to handle a variety of data models and are not strictly based on the traditional tabular relational database model. They support a flexible schema, allowing for the storage of different types of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Schema:** NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a dynamic schema, which means that data can be inserted without a predefined structure. This flexibility is advantageous when dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Integrity:** NoSQL databases may not strictly adhere to ACID properties. Instead, they often prioritize performance, scalability, and availability (CAP theorem), sacrificing some aspects of data consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Scaling:** NoSQL databases are generally more scalable than SQL databases. They can scale horizontally, meaning you can add more servers to distribute the load.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Examples:** MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application. SQL databases are well-suited for applications with complex queries and transactions, where data consistency is critical. NoSQL databases are often chosen for applications with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and where horizontal scalability is essential."

        "\n",
        "Here are some key DDL commands and their explanations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **CREATE:**\n",
        "   - **Purpose:** The CREATE command is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.\n",
        "   - **Example:**\n",

        "         EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

        "     In this example, the CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table named \"Employees\" with columns for EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, and DepartmentID.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **DROP:**\n",
        "   - **Purpose:** The DROP command is used to remove existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.\n",
        "   - **Example:**\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     This SQL statement removes the \"Employees\" table from the database. Be cautious when using DROP, as it permanently deletes the specified object and its data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **ALTER:**\n",
        "   - **Purpose:** The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or dropping columns from a table.\n",
        "   - **Example:**\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
        "     ADD COLUMN Email VARCHAR(100);\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     Here, the ALTER TABLE statement is used to add a new column named \"Email\" to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **TRUNCATE:**\n",
        "   - **Purpose:** The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all rows from a table while keeping its structure intact. Unlike DROP, TRUNCATE does not delete the table itself.\n",
        "   - **Example:**\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     This SQL statement removes all rows from the \"Employees\" table, leaving the table structure in place. It is faster than using DELETE to remove all rows because it doesn't log individual row deletions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, DDL commands (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE) are essential for defining and managing the structure of a database. They allow database administrators and developers to create new objects, modify existing ones, or remove objects as needed. These commands play a crucial role in shaping the overall architecture and design of a relational database."

        "\n",
        "2. **`execute()` Method:**\n",
        "   - The `execute()` method is used to execute a SQL query or command. It takes the SQL statement as its argument and, optionally, parameters to substitute into the SQL statement.\n",
        "   - In Example 1, `cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM your_table\")` executes a SELECT query to fetch all rows from the specified table.\n",
        "   - In Example 2, `cursor.execute(insert_query, new_data)` executes an INSERT query to add new data to the specified table. The `%s` placeholders in the SQL query are placeholders for values provided in the `new_data` tuple. This helps prevent SQL injection by automatically escaping and quoting values.\n",

        "2. **WHERE Clause:**\n",
        "   - The WHERE clause filters the rows based on a specified condition. Only the rows that meet the condition will be included in the result set.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **GROUP BY Clause:**\n",
        "   - The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like in aggregate functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **HAVING Clause:**\n",
        "   - The HAVING clause filters the grouped rows based on a specified condition. It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on grouped data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **SELECT Clause:**\n",
        "   - The SELECT clause specifies the columns that will be included in the result set. It comes after the FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **ORDER BY Clause:**\n",
        "   - The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It comes after the SELECT clause.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **LIMIT and OFFSET (Optional):**\n",
        "   - The LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows in the result set, and the OFFSET clause is used to skip a specified number of rows. These clauses are often used for pagination and come at the end of the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that not all queries include all these clauses, and their presence depends on the specific requirements of the query. For example, a simple query may only have the SELECT and FROM clauses, while more complex queries may include additional clauses as needed. Additionally, some clauses like GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET are optional and may or may not be present in a given query."
